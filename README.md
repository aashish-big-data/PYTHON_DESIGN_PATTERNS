DESIGN_PATTERNS


SOLID DESIGN principles 

Single-responsibility principle==>
  A class should only have a single responsibility, that is, only changes to one part of the software's specification should be able to affect the specification of the class.

Openâ€“closed principle==>
  Software entities ... should be open for extension, but closed for modification

Liskov substitution principle==>
  Objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program." See also design by contract.

Interface segregation principle==>
  Having specific intefaces separately. OLD PRINTER should not have FAX implementation, which can be misleading even , we do not implement it.
  

Dependency inversion principle==>
  One should depend upon abstraction and not on internal implementation.
  Client code should not be affected with base changes in base classes.
